Hugin CLI
============

There are several guides for Hugin CLI developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
documentation/index.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``. The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://cli.hugin.chat/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the Hugin CLI, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your Hugin CLI.
