The Hugin CLI documentation
==============================

This is the top level of the Hugin CLI's documentation tree. Hugin CLI
documentation, like the Hugin CLI itself, is very much a work in progress;
that is especially true as we work to integrate our many scattered
documents into a coherent whole. Please note that improvements to the
documentation are welcome; join the Hugin Development group at `4820de8e26d21981afe6de2ff7b62fa6aa01126482ca0faeff151886c73619e5` if
you want to help out.
